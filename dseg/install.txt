installation of blas, my notes
used theano.config.blas.ldflags = "-Li:\\downloads\\OpenBLAS-develop\\OpenBLAS-develop -lopenblas"
used msys.bat to start a shell
downloaded openblas from git hub
used symbolic link to my i: drive created in cygwin (it worked from msys) to get to the downloaded folder
used quickbuild.win32 (it mentioned an error, but it also said it was ignored)
put the dll in the path like this:
cp libopenblas.dll /i/software/MinGW/bin/
